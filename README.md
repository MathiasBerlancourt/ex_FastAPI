```

### Run it

Run the server with:

<div class="termy">

$ uvicorn main:app --reload

INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [28720]
INFO:     Started server process [28722]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

</div>

The command `uvicorn main:app` refers to:

- `main`: the file `main.py` (the Python "module").
- `app`: the object created inside of `main.py` with the line `app = FastAPI()`.
- `--reload`: make the server restart after code changes. Only do this for development.
